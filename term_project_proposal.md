Term Project Proposal

The Big Idea:
The main idea of this project is to create a bot that accesses the Nike website and buys a pair of shoes. Ideally, the bot will be able to perform the following tasks: open Google Chrome, go to the Nike website, search up a specific pair of shoes, choose the needed size, add the shoes to the shopping cart, proceed to checkout, insert necessary information, and complete the transaction. Our minimum viable product is a bot that can do all the steps listed except completing the transaction. This may be difficult due to possible bot restrictions on the Nike website. Our stretch goal is to have the bot recognize the availability of the shoe, and if it is out of stock to have a way to notify the user when it is back in stock and perform the tasks immediately.

Learning Goals: 
Shared goals for our team is being able to create code that is understandable to our teammates. To create readable code, it must have comments and docstrings, but should also be simple. This will help us debug each otherâ€™s code. In addition, we want to enhance our pair programming skills, which we will have to implement in this project, since people cannot work on code at once. Individually, we want to understand the different concepts we will need to make our code work, like libraries and their functions. We will consider ourselves successful if we can all understand for what purpose each code is used for, and be able to reiterate it ourselves.

Implementation Plan:
So far, we have done some research on how bots are built using Python. Bot have many different purposes and there are videos and sites online that guide how to build chat bots, information bots, transactional bots, crawlers. From these sources we are trying to determine what type bot we will be implementing, since we want our bot to purchase shoes, but additionally would want our bot to also notify the user on when the shoes are available. We may have to create two separate bots for this, but we are still looking for different avenues to approach this. There are templates available to help us create these bots. We have not yet decided which template to follow, or where or not we are going to combine templates to fit our needs. However, from various templates, we have determined we will have to use a library called botbuilder or selenium, which help perform web scraping and build bots. We think that the template will be finalized through trial and error. We will begin with our basic structure of the bot buying shoes, and once that is successful we will add on the notification aspect.
 
Project schedule: 
3/26 - Finish all pre-starting research and settle on the specific libraries we will use, and which template to start with. (Right now we are thinking of using the Microsoft Emulator bot template)
4/2 - Have the pseudo code completed and have the complete outline of the code completed. Some bugs are okay, but the coding plan should be completely solidified.
4/9 - Debug and finalize the code, it should be working. The code for the stretch plan should also be completed.
4/16 - Complete the project website, and prepare for class demo

Collaboration plan: 
We are going to do pair programming and use the Agile Development methodology. We will set specific days of the week and time slots where our team will meet to do coding. These time slots will be 1 hour each, and we will rotate the coder each time, so make sure that everyone gets a chance to code. This will also make sure that there are fresh eyes looking at the code, which will help with debugging. Since we will be pair programming, everyone should understand what the code does and be able to take control immediately. By using the Agile Development methodology, we will be able to review the code at the beginning of each coding session to go through what we have already done and see what we can make better, while making headway towards our end product. We as a team approach problems through trial and error, and have determined that this development methodology will ensure we are efficient and effective with our time.

Risks: 
One of the biggest risks to the success of our project is bot prevention software like Captcha (type the letters and numbers present or click of the image that contains a car). However, there are ways to work around this, but we may not be able to within our timeline. As of right now, we do not foresee any other risks, but this does not mean that there are not any roadblocks that can hinder our progress.

Additional Course Content: 
Some topics that we have covered in class that will help us in this project are Flask and libraries from the text analysis module, such as json. In the templates which we have researched so far, these are some familiar libraries we have come across. We are hoping that since we have some experience with these, we will be able to implement these templates more efficiently.
